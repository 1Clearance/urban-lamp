    				<h2><u>Computer</u></h2>
    				<img src="images/computer.jpg" class="img-rounded">
    				<p>A <strong>Computer</strong> is the electronic machine that operates under the instruction stored in it own memory to accapt data or manupilate data for a specif use/puprose. The following are the things that make a computer to be a computer and without them a computer can never operates.</p>
    				<ol type="i" style="background-color: pink">
    					<li>Input</li>
    					<li>Storage</li>
    					<li>Processor</li>
    					<li>Output</li>
    				</ol>
    				<p>With compute there is much that can be done, with computer we do the emailing, use it to communicate with the world, store data and safe our things inside our computer, however computrer are part of our lives. We communicate with our loved once using our computer and we are able to predict lots of things using the computer</p>
    				<p>The basicaaly of computer is that a person can play games, do spreadsheet though the computer or even make some presentation. It allows or perhaps lets just say, it stand as madiator between a man and his future. Without a computer a lot of things cannot operates, things like communication</p>
    				<img src="images/download.jpg" alt="computer" class="img-circle">
    				<p>Computer can think more efficient and can do a lot at the sametime. It is a multitask machine, it is one of the examples of AI. But the way computer operate it is difference compare to how a man can do. If a man were to operate as the way computer operates, it would take lot of time to get to the answeres.</p>
    				<p>Oftern when people hear the work <mark style="color: red;">Computer</mark> they think of <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Desktop or Personal computer,</mark> yet computer comes in different forms. As i have indicated ealier that computers plays a huge role in our lives.</p>
    				<h3>The following are some examples of compouter</h3>
    				<p>When we talk about computer we actually are not reffering to desktop or laptops only, any device that can manage to maupilate and accept data is reffered as a computer. for example, the following are some of computers that are know and some of them, people are not even aware that they form part of computting.</p>

    				<h2><u>Binary</u></h2>
    				<img src="images/binary.jpg" alt="binary" class="img-rounded" width="125" height="85">
    				<p><strong><mark style="background-color: yellow; color: red;">A binary</mark></strong><mark style="background-color: yellow;">is a base 2 number that is made of two: 0 and 1. <strong><mark style="color: red;">Binary</mark></strong>is also a system of representing number using 1<sub>s</sub> and 0<sub>s</sub></mark></p>
    				<p>When we talk about <strong>Binary</strong> we talk about the langauge of the computer. A langauge that the software uses in order to operate the hard or to instruct the hardware what to do. Computer have thier own language they they use to communicate and that language is known as <strong><mark style="color: red;">Binary</mark></strong></p>
    				<p>Computer uses 1 and 0. Everything that does apear in the computer is translated to 1<sub>s</sub> and 0<sub>s</sub>. <strong><mark style="color: red;">Binary</mark></strong> relating to, composed of, involving two things. Relating to, using or denoting numerical notation that has 2 rather than 10 as a base. <mark style="color: red;">Binary number</mark> is made of two element called bit, where each bit can be one of two state. Generally, we represent them with numbers 0<sub>s</sub> and 1<sub>s</sub>.</p>
    				<p><strong><mark style="background-color: blue;">Binary</mark></strong> has types also and down here we are going to study about the types of binary. Binary we used by old generation computer and even the moden generation of computer still use binaries. Binaries are the computer raw language that it uses to read and understand and be able to respond accordingly to the client the type of information it needs to comply accodingly. Binaries uses 1<sub>s</sub> and 0<sub>s</sub> or perhaps on and ofd, sauch that 0 is the same as of and 1 is the same as on.</p>
    				<p>Whether it is storing data or executing command, or any other command, or any other application, computers and other digitial system available today uses different types of binary code to carry out the action according to the user interface that the user instruct through graphical interface</p>

    						<h4 style="background-color: yellow">weighted codes</h4>
    						<p style="color: red;">A weight binary code follow the positional principle where each digit in number is assigned a specific value or weight before it converted, and that value is also depandant on the binary bit is positioned</p>
    						<li>Binary coded decimal code</li>
    						<li>Non-weighted code</li>
    						<li>Gray code</li>
    						<li>alphanumeric code</li>

       					<h4 style="background-color: gray; color: skyblue;">Binary coded decimal codes</h4>
       				<p>This is <strong><mark style="background-color: yellow;">BCD<sub>code</sub></mark></strong> is one of the most popular types of codes used in the wide range of moden aplication. This type of code compromise of decimal degits where 4-bit binary number represent each degits. The major advantage of binary coded decimal is that, it is quitesimilor to decimal system allowing the user to remeber the conversional of decimal number od 0-9</p>
       				<h4 style="background-color: gray; color: skyblue;">Non-weighted code</h4>
       				<p>This type of binary codes doesn't involve assigning any positional weights, but still perform conversisional from binary to other system. non-weighted codes can be used in a number of ways such as:
       					<ol type="i" style="background-color: pink">
       						<li>For error detection in different operations</li>
       						<li>For shifting position encoded</li>
       						<li>For perfoming certain types of arthematic operation</li></p>

    				<h4><strong><mark style="background-color: blue; color: red;">Gray code</mark></strong></h4>
    				<p><mark style="background-color: gray;">Gray code</mark> is another type weighted code that does link with arthemetic codes. meaning that is doesnt havae any special bit possion, in other word it is cyclic code. In this method, only one bit of binary number is altered when a decimal number is moved to the next. Since only a single  bit is changed. Gray coding method is also known as a unit distance code.</p>
    			

    			
    				<h4><strong><mark style="background-color: gray;">Alphanumeric code</mark></strong></h4>
    				<p>It is well-established fact that the representation of binary bit or digital limited to just have sysmbols <i>i.g</i> o<sub>s</sub> and 1<sub>s</sub>. However, as the computer have developed signitically over the past few years, this has made communication between two computers difficult, because there are a whole host of more symbols including in the communication, for instance  there are 260 alphabet with small and capital variation. </p>
    				<p>In such situation, the alphanumaric codes are used that have the ability to represent both alphabet and numbers. Noy only that, they can also be used for representing characters, symbols and several forms of instructions that are necesary for ttransfering information from one device to another. Aphanumeric can representing the total of 36 items, 26 and 10 digits</p>
    				<p><u><mark style="color: tomato;">Some of the most commonly used alphanumaric code used for data representation are:</mark></u></p>
    				<p><u><strong><mark style="background-color: lime; color: brown"><i><mark style="color: blue;">"EBCDIC"</mark></i> Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code</mark></strong></u> being developed <mark style="color: brown;">"IBM"</mark> and is an 8-bit alphanumeric code that is capable of supporting 256 sysmbol. It is for operating <mark style="color: brown;">IBM</mark>
    				mainframe computer</p>
    				<p><u><strong><mark style="background-color: lime; color: brown;"><i><mark style="color: blue">ASCII</mark></i>Americal Standard code for information interchange</mark></strong></u> it is popular world wide than <mark style="color: brown">EBCDIC. ASCII</mark> is an alphanumeric code for both 7-bit and 8-bit. The 7-bit code support 127 characters while 8-bit codes support 256 characters</p>
    				<h4><strong><mark style="background-color: gray">Error codes</mark></strong></h4>
    				<p>Some binary code techiniques are used for detecting and correcting in data that typically occures during data transmission. These codes are additional bit of data, known as parity bit</p>
